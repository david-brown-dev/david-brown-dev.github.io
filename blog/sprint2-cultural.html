          <h2>My Learning Objectives</h2>
          <p>
            My learning goals at EDA are primarily technical with a focus on developing my capabilities in the
            technical aspects of Web Development. I also want to build my ability to work in an Agile team environment.
            My
            career goal is to become a web developer long-term or at some point transition to a product management
            position.
            The capabilities I want to focus on during my time at EDA are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript front-end development interacting with DOM elements and managing front-end communication with
              APIs
            </li>
            <li>JavaScript back-end development, data transformation and building APIs with node.js etc</li>
            <li>CSS manipulation, planning and using frameworks such as bootstrap</li>
            <li>HTML usage and best practice for accessible websites</li>
            <li>Agile based, group working situations</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>My Key Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
          <p>Strengths:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>18 years of IT experience for contextualisation</li>
            <li>Strong questioning and communication skills, including explaining complex concepts</li>
            <li>Ability to analyse and solve complex problems</li>
            <li>Business acumen</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Weaknesses:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Limited development knowledge and experience with HTML, CSS and JS</li>
            <li>Poor understanding of development ecosystem</li>
            <li>No recent experience of working in team environments and I have never had to work so closely with others
              before. I may struggle with patience and very different personalities than Iâ€™m used to</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>My Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            I am 100% dedicated to this course and making the most of my opportunity. Each week of foundations I will
            ensure
            that I clearly understand my learning objectives and complete the stretch activities. I will also use any
            leftover
            time to deepen my learning in the cover concepts. I will dedicate at minimum 40 hours per week to
            foundations
            and
            boot camp with the boot camp hours being on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            When working with others in pair or team environments, I will ensure I honour my commits of time and work to
            my
            team. I will commit to being a reliable and patient learning partner, respecting others learning journeys
            and
            scheduling challenges.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, I will manage my workload, stress levels and productivity by ensuring that I reach out to
            facilitators
            when I need help with something I can solve myself. I will do this either face to face or via slack.</p>
          <h2>My Expectations of the Facilitation Team</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To give good guidance on learning resources that I can use to improve my understanding of concepts</li>
            <li>Facilitate active classroom environments that enable learning from teachers, peers and practical
              activities
            </li>
            <li>To be responsive if my pace of learning is faster than other class members</li>
            <li>Be clear and accurate with communication</li>
            <li>Have a high degree of integrity, do what you commit to</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>My Scheduling Challenges</h2>
          <p>There are no ongoing reasons that I would not be able to dedicate my full attention and attendance however
            should
            one arise, I will promptly discuss with my facilitator.</p>

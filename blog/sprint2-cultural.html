    <p>This is my draft learning plan for the EDA Web Development course. It sets out my objectives for learning,
      current strengths and weaknesses, commitment to the process and expectations on facilitators.</p>
    <h2>My Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      My learning goals at EDA are primarily technical with a focus on developing my capabilities in the
      technical aspects of Web Development. I also want to build my ability to work in an Agile team environment. My
      career goal is to become a web developer long-term or at some point transition to a product management position.
      The capabilities I want to focus on during my time at EDA are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript front-end development interacting with DOM elements and managing front-end communication with APIs
      </li>
      <li>JavaScript back-end development, data transformation and building APIs with node.js etc</li>
      <li>CSS manipulation, planning and using frameworks such as bootstrap</li>
      <li>HTML usage and best practice for accessible websites</li>
      <li>Agile based, group working situations</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My Key Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
    <p>Strengths:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>18 years of IT experience for contextualisation</li>
      <li>Strong questioning and communication skills, including explaining complex concepts</li>
      <li>Ability to analyse and solve complex problems</li>
      <li>Business acumen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Weaknesses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited development knowledge and experience with HTML, CSS and JS</li>
      <li>Poor understanding of development ecosystem</li>
      <li>No recent experience of working in team environments and I have never had to work so closely with others
        before. I may struggle with patience and very different personalities than Iâ€™m used to</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      I am 100% dedicated to this course and making the most of my opportunity. Each week of foundations I will ensure
      that I clearly understand my learning objectives and complete the stretch activities. I will also use any leftover
      time to deepen my learning in the cover concepts. I will dedicate at minimum 40 hours per week to foundations and
      boot camp with the boot camp hours being on campus.
    </p>
    <p>
      When working with others in pair or team environments, I will ensure I honour my commits of time and work to my
      team. I will commit to being a reliable and patient learning partner, respecting others learning journeys and
      scheduling challenges.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I will manage my workload, stress levels and productivity by ensuring that I reach out to facilitators
      when I need help with something I can solve myself. I will do this either face to face or via slack.</p>
    <h2>My Expectations of the Facilitation Team</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To give good guidance on learning resources that I can use to improve my understanding of concepts</li>
      <li>Facilitate active classroom environments that enable learning from teachers, peers and practical activities
      </li>
      <li>To be responsive if my pace of learning is faster than other class members</li>
      <li>Be clear and accurate with communication</li>
      <li>Have a high degree of integrity, do what you commit to</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <p>There are no ongoing reasons that I would not be able to dedicate my full attention and attendance however should
      one arise, I will promptly discuss with my facilitator.</p>

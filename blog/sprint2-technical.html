        When you view a website on your computer or mobile phone, the browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Firefox etc) 
        needs to read in the website's code and interpret it in order to display the page for you to read. That code is made up of two 
        key elements: HTML which is the structure and content and CSS which is a collection of rules that tell the browser how that 
        content should be displayed. For example, whether the text is red or blue, big or small, just about every potential display 
        option you can think of!
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the rules that can be set in CSS is the <strong>display</strong> property. Everything on a website, each part being known as an <strong>element</strong>, 
        can be configured with the display property. For this blog post I will be concentrating 
        on two important display property options; <strong>inline</strong> and <strong>inline-block</strong>. For most elements, their default display setting is <strong>block</strong>. 
        This means that each element stacks on top of the next like a single width Lego tower, as seen below. Like Lego blocks they 
        can have dimensions such as width and height so we can make them as big or small as needed.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Figure A - CSS Display Block</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In order to place the elements next to each other we use either <strong>inline</strong> or <strong>inline-block</strong>. When we use <strong>inline</strong>, as we can see below the 
        two elements of text will sit next to each other as opposed to on top of each other like when we use <strong>block</strong>.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/inline.PNG" alt="Figure B - CSS Display Inline">
        <figcaption>Figure B - CSS Display Inline</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        This is great when we need elements to appear right next to each other for example in a sentence however if we did this with 
        every element, the website would soon become messy and unreadable because <strong>inline</strong> elements don’t accept height and width. Even if you 
        tried to set it, the browser would just ignore it and when we try and move elements apart using padding to give a bit more white space between them, 
        with <strong>inline</strong>, we don’t exactly get a great result.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/inline-padding.PNG" alt="Figure C - CSS Display Inline with Padding">
        <figcaption>Figure C - CSS Display Inline with Padding</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        As you can see, we were able to push the second element out sideways but not up and down. In fact we just end up making it worse by 
        masking the third line! Fortunately we have <strong>inline-block</strong> which solves this problem for us. <strong>Inline-block</strong> allows elements to act like 
        blocks having width and height dimensions as well as enabling us to pad white space around them. They also can fit on the same line together!
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/inline-block.PNG" alt="Figure D - CSS Display Inline-Block">
        <figcaption>Figure D - CSS Display Inline-Block</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>Inline</strong> and <strong>Inline-Block</strong> both seem similar due to solving the key problem of putting elements next to each other. On closer 
        inspection however, they are very different with <strong>inline-block</strong> clearly the more powerful and robust. In general I would recommend using 
        <strong>inline-block</strong> primarily as it will give you the flexibility to manipulate it like any other element. Use <strong>inline</strong> only when you know you will not need to 
        set the dimensions or enable white space between elements.

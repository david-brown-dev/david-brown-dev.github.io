    <h2>Ethical Decisions</h2>
    <p>
      The field of sales is a minefield of ethical decisions. Trust is a crucial part of the sales process and trust
      over a short time is often built with confidence, conviction, competence and integrity. The integrity aspect is
      especially difficult as trust is often leveraged for the benefit of you or your organisation and interests between
      client and vendor do not always perfect align.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always held integrity to be an important value that I expect in myself as well as others. There is a sure
      way of losing trust which is not doing what you say you will do. My example of this came during an initial meeting
      I had with a new client in Abu Dhabi. I had driven for 2 hours to get to the meeting and had dedicated a
      significant part of my day to this, not to mention the preparation work for the meeting. I arrived on-time and met
      the clients EA who advised me he was running late but shouldn’t be too long. After 20 minutes of waiting, which
      was already much longer than normal, the PA advised that he was still in a meeting but wouldn’t be much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point I had an ethical decision to make. Was expecting the client to have the integrity to keep to the
      appointment time made more important to me than the cost of leaving? The cost of leaving could have been quite
      high. When working towards quarterly and yearly targets, any time spent that is not advancing your progress to
      those targets is a negative thing. Also when you only have a set number of people to sell to, saying no to someone
      who might buy is risky.
    </p>
    <p>Not without regret, I made the decision to leave, making clear to the EA that I had other business to attend to
      and that the time remaining for the meeting wouldn’t do justice to the topic we were covering. I decided to live
      up to the value I believed in and in doing so I was able to ensure that the relationship with my client would
      always have that value as one we both needed to uphold. </p>
      <h2>My Cultural Influences</h2>
    <p>Growing up, I was strongly influenced by the concepts of self-reliance and self-sufficiency. These are two values
      I continue to hold dear to my heart, even if not quite with the same reverence I did when I was younger. I
      strongly value my ability to do something for myself, relying on my own abilities to solve a challenge gives me an
      enormous sense of accomplishment. This is especially true in a learning context where learning something myself
      helps me to ensure that I truly understand that concept. I still value this strongly in myself however I expect
      this less and less from others as I have come to understand that this is not something everyone shares as strongly
      as me.</p>
      <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
    <p>One of my key strengths on this learning journey is my absolute belief that I will be successful on this journey.
      This enables me to address new challenges and concepts with a mindset that they are just steps on the way to
      becoming a web developer and that any challenges in understanding will, with enough application and focus be
      easily overcome. Certainly nothing that could stop my goals from being realised.</p>
    <p>One of my weaknesses is a bit of a lack of confidence and understanding about how my previous career connects
      into this new role. The path I have chosen is not common in IT and I will need support in understanding how to
      integrate this previous career into a web development narrative.</p>
      <h2>Working with Others</h2>
    <p>In my recent working experience, working with others is simply about finding common ground and agreeing to work
      together on it. I would need to stretch back over 10 years since I was working in a team environment to find an
      example of team disharmony. I was working in an IT professional services organisation deploying a major project
      for one of our leaning clients. </p>
    <p>I was the lean consultant responsible for the project however the amount of work involved was far too great for
      one parson. I reached out to involve members of my team to undertake certain parts of the documentation work
      however they were reluctant due to not really understanding what needed to be done. After explaining it to them
      they agreed to take on the work but there was tension due to the average quality of work produced and the lack of
      respect of deadlines that had been set. </p>
    <p>In the end I found that I couldn’t get them to engage with the project in the same way I had because likely they
      hadn’t been involved from the start and they simply cared more about their own projects and project deadlines. I
      had to accept their work as is and then go about improving the quality. In the end the mistake was mine for not
      getting them involved from the start and ensuring they had a sense of ownership over the success of the project.

          <h2>The difference between HTML and CSS</h2>
          <p>I’m going to use a human body analogy to try and describe the relationships between HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript, hopefully without getting too gross! If a website is like a human then HTML would be all of the
            body parts. A human needs bones, organs, skin, muscles etc and HTML gives us the definition of what parts we
            will include in our human and a general order of how they should appear. If you drop something heavy on your
            foot and end up losing a toe, then you have altered the HTML of your body so to speak.</p>
          <p>Now on their own a list of parts isn’t going to get us a functioning human. We need to know things like the
            size of the parts, colours, positioning relative to other parts etc and that’s where CSS comes in. The CSS
            of a human gives us all of the details about how we should look. If you have one arm shorter than the other,
            that’s CSS. I was born with different coloured eyes which is definitely a CSS quirk.</p>
            <h2>JavaScript Control Flow</h2>
          <p>Finally we have JavaScript. JavaScript tells the body how to function and gives us the animation that
            brings a body to life (no religious/scientific offence intended, I did mention that this was a terrible
            analogy). Our human JavaScript program provides logic for how we as humans should operate. For example, in
            the morning when I wake up, I complete a series of activities such as going to the toilet, having a
            shower, brushing my teeth and having breakfast. This sequence of operations and the order in which they
            happen is my control flow of my human JavaScript program. With this basic flow I know the general order of
            activities I do in the morning but for how long and when I should do them require a bit more logic.</p>
          <p>Taking a closer look at how I eat my breakfast, from my initial control flow we can see that it comes
            directly after brushing my teeth. But for how long do I eat? And if I’m running late should I eat at all?
            We can configure this in our human JavaScript program using loops and IF statements. Let’s say I am eating
            a bowl of oats in the morning, I can use a while loop to control my eating and when I stop: <code>While I am
              still hungry, eat another spoonful of oats</code>. With this loop after each spoonful I will check again
            to see
            if I’m still hungry and while I still am, I’ll continue to eat. I’ll stop only once I’m full and move onto
            the next activity.</p>
          <p>I eat oats because it’s quick in the morning but what if I have a bit of extra time? I might want to make
            some scrambled eggs! Well I can use an IF statement to control this. I can say in my human JavaScript
            program: <code>If the time left before work is greater than 1 hour, make eggs, otherwise, make oats</code>.
            Here I have
            essentially said that if I have more than an hour before work, I’ve got time for some eggs but if that
            condition isn’t true and it’s say only 20 mins to go, I need to be making oats.</p>
            <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
          <p>With these loops and if statements in our control flow we can start to build in a logic to our human
            JavaScript program to manage what we do in specific situations. When we have actions we repeat on a
            regular basis we can make these into functions. Functions in our human JavaScript program allow us to call
            up repeated actions such as brushing our teeth, something that we do exactly the same each time, without
            having to write out the same code over and over. If I was building a human to work over a period of 80
            years, I would need to have that human brush their teeth at least 60,000 times. Writing that same code out
            that many times is a waste when we can just continually reference the code which is how we can use
            functions to save code and time with repetitive tasks.</p>
            <h2>The DOM, arrays and objects</h2>
          <p>My human analogy comes to an end now but I still need to cover two more topics for my blog this sprint:
            The DOM and accessing arrays and objects.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The DOM is a model which collects all of the HTML and CSS properties into a tree-like hierarchical,
              key/value pair structure that can then be accessed and modified by an object oriented programming
              language such as JavaScript. For example, we can create a JavaScript program to change the background
              colour on our webpage from blue to red. We use the DOM to do this as it presents the style property
              background-color on our html

              &lt;body&gt; element in an object format that our JavaScript program can easily reference and
              understand.</li>
            <li>An array is an object but an object is different from an array, or at least an array is a type of
              object…. Confused? Well in simple terms, an array is like a list. My shopping list can easily be an
              array: Milk, bread, eggs, cheese etc. When we refer to an object in this context we are talking about a
              set of key/value pairs. For example, my pantry and its contents can be an object: Eggs: 12, Bread: 8
              slices, Milk: 4 bottles, Cheese: 1 block.</li>

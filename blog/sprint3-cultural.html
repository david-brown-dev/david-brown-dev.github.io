          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to identify and deal with your own emotions as well as the emotions
            of others around you. There are generally thought to be 3 key skills associated with emotional intelligence:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The ability to recognize your own emotions</li>
            <li>The ability to use those emotions in tasks like thinking or problem solving</li>
            <li>The ability to manage your emotions when necessary for example when you need to cheer someone else up
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>IQ or Intelligence Quotient is a measure of your reasoning ability and covers how well you can use
            information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. It covers areas like memorisation, spatial
            ability and mathematical comprehension etc. EQ on the other hand is as mentioned above, the ability to
            recognise and manage one’s own emotions and the emotions of others. </p>
          <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa
            people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the
            journey
            over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat
            up
            properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet
            potatoes)
            situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
          </p>
          <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
          <p>Workplaces are environments full of relationships. They are a melting pot of different personalities,
            skills, strengths, and emotions. All of this is trying to fulfil the purpose of the business.</p>
          <p>So EQ is involved in each and every decision and action within the workplace. It’s there when pair
            programming just as much as coordinating sweeping organisational changes. Therefore people with a high EQ
            will typically be better placed to better navigate the workplace and all of the intricacies of relationships
            that make it up.</p>
          <p>In contrast, a low EQ can be extremely detrimental in the workplace, leading to aggression, bullying,
            arrogance and other demotivating workplace behaviours.</p>

          <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the term given to the brains ability to change and adapt over the course of one’s life
            and through our interactions with our environment. The benefits of neuroplasticity have been seen in stroke victims,
            people who have lost limbs and brain injury where, as opposed to loosing function, the brain can reconfigure
            to continue to allow a function that would normally have taken part in the damaged portion of the brain.
          </p>
          <p>
            This also has an obvious effect on learning. Even just knowing about neuroplasticity can help to overcome
            some of the mental barriers associated with learning and one’s perception of one’s own intellect. In
            undertaking this course at EDA, I will be ensuring that I maximise my brains ability to change and ensure
            permanent learning takes place by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Getting good quality sleep</li>
            <li>Continually learning</li>
            <li>Keeping stress levels low</li>
            <li>Engage in projects that I can understand the purpose of to maximise relational connections</li>
            <li>Keep away from negative influences</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>
            Having a growth mind-set is to have the understanding that abilities and intelligence can be developed. Our
            brains are not fixed and the more we learn and practice the smarter we can get. Having a growth mind-set,
            especially at the outset of learning a new skill, is critical as it breaks down the mental barriers that we
            put in place that say “we aren’t smart enough to do this”. For me a growth mind-set is nothing new, the idea
            is highly utilised in the IT sales sector as a way to challenge mental barriers of which there are an
            unlimited number in sales. I’m undertaking this course in part because I already believe in a growth
            mind-set and have absolute confidence that I will make a great developer and also love doing it.
          </p>

            From a resource perspective, take a look at Gartner’s piece on growth mind-set in technology leadership
            roles being critical for the digital business journey.

          <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
          <h3>Getting Blocked:</h3>
          <p>
            What does it mean to be blocked? Well for me coding is a process and one that is not always producing at a
            consistent speed. There are times when my knowledge is lacking and I need to turn to resources like MDN or
            Stack overflow to clarify what a method is doing or how others have solved a problem. There are times when
            my program is throwing an exception or worse still, successfully not working! These instances I turn to the
            debugger or logging to get some insight.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of these situations to me a being blocked. They are simply part of the coding process. To be blocked
            for me is to face a seemingly insurmountable obstacle without the help or action of someone else. In this
            sprint I never faced a challenge such as this however I did get slowed down significantly on a simple
            problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the built-in methods challenge on relp.it, I had written a function to find Scooby that looked great
            as far as I could see but was not passing one of the tests. I spent some time focused on solving the
            problem, convinced that it was my use of the “this” keyword and scratching my head frustrated as to what was
            going wrong. In the end I solved the problem by actually reading the error and the test that it was failing
            to find I simply hadn’t accounted for the array being empty. My main takeaway from this is I need to be
            continually vigilant when it comes to both reading instructions and error messages carefully. My tendency is
            to skim read and assume I understood as opposed to reading carefully and really understanding.
          </p>
          <h3>Elegant Solutions:</h3>
          <p>
            While I would like to think that all of my code is elegant, my best example was using the chaining of
            methods to capatialise the first letter of every word in a sentence. I needed to make 3 changes to the
            sentence I was given and as opposed to writing 3 different lines of code to make those changes, I chained
            the 3 methods together in one return statement that significantly simplified the reading of my function.
          </p>
          <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
          <p>
            As I mentioned above, problem solving is all part of the development process and I already use many of the
            techniques listed today. Googling, console.logging, try something, rubber ducky (or a variation where I
            explain it to myself), reading error messages and debugging are all areas I am comfortable with. Pseudocode
            is something that I think is great for collaboration and complex problems. Asking for help for me will
            always be the last step for me especially in the early days of knowing a person and developing a level of
            trust in their answers and capabilities.

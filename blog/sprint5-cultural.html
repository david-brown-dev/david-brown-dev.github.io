          <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            Not sure if I can name three but the one that comes to mind was during the Identity and values exploration
            exercise, I was able to see just how important self-awareness is to me and put a name to it for the first
            time as a value that as important to me. The other one I would say is during the looping and listening
            activity, just how important to me empathy is.
          </p>
          <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            Honestly, just difficult and rare listening is for people!
          </p>
          <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            Putting together my learning plan as it’s not a document I have ever written before and I really wasn’t sure
            how to frame it.
          </p>
          <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
          <p>
            Because your core focus is to train for employment and IT employers are desire programmers with good people
            skills over and above technical skills.
          </p>
          <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer</h2>
          <p>
            No not at all. Firstly there wasn’t that much time dedicated to it so the work in core was not onerous. Also
            the core skills genuinely are desirable among employers. Finally I think they will be critical for a
            bootcamp scenario where people are working so closely together using pair programming. If we hadn’t covered
            these, the bootcamp may be much less productive.
